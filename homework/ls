#$PATH includes the paths where are binary executable commands
#each executed command that was being executed is in paths of $PATH

#For first I created this file which name is ls, which will be executed and print "Hello World"
echo "#!/bin/bash" > ls
echo "echo "Hello World"" >> ls

#$PATH searches for written command in its value paths, from start to end, as we dont want to run our standart ls command which is in /usr/bin, so that the $PATH doesnt reached to that path, I should add path file ofmy created ls file, of the first part of $PATH value

#For that this command is correct -> export PATH=~/:$PATH
#now whenever the ls command written $PATH first will search under my home directory
export PATH=~/:$PATH

#Making executable file
chmod u+x ~/ls
